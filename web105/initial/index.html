    <h2>Dogs Cuddling</h2>

    <p>My larger dog, Rocky is laying on our puppy, Honey. He loves to cuddle her. This was taken when we first got our puppy. 
    <br>  Now that they are older they still are inseparable. Honey, the puppy, won't go anywhere without my oldest dog, Rocky.

    <h2>Our Family Photo</h2>
    <img src="family.jpg" alt=" Family photo"width=550>
    <p> This was our first professional family photo with out new baby. My husband, our two daughters and myself.
        <br> My oldest was eight years old and my youngest was two months old when this picture was taken. 
       <br>  My name is Holly, my husband's name is Jesus, my oldest is named Aubrey and my youngest is named Kloe.

    <h2>My Grandma Holding Kloe</h2>
    <img src="grandma.jpg" alt=" Grandma holding her grandchild" width=400>
    <p>This was the first time my grandmother held my youngest child. We don't see her often, as she lives in North Carolina.
      <br>  It was an emotional time, as my grandfather (her husband) had just passed and didn't get to meet the new baby.
      <br>   Holding her grandchild was both a sad and a happy moment.</p>
