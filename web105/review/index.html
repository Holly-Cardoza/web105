    <p style="font-size:250%;font-family:initial;"><pre>       
    This is Us, is a tv show about three siblings and thier father who passed away when they were teenagers.
    The show is describing thier childhood with thier father and the love life of thier mother and father.
    The show includes thier lives now as they are adults with thier families.
    Each epsiode goes back and forth through time or the memories of the family, with <strong> Jack</strong>, the father.
    The mother,<strong>(Rebecca)</strong>  was supposed to have triplets, but one of them died during child birth.
    At the same time they were in the hospital a baby was abandoned with no home.
    Jack decided it was meant to be and took in the baby, as they were prepared for three babies anyway.
    Throughout the show Jack is protrayed as a great father and husband.

    <p style="font-size:250%;font-family:initial;font-size:200%;"><pre>
    This is a <mark>family show</mark>, something the whole family can watch.
    It doesn't have nuditity, cussing, or sexual situations. It is a clean cut family show.
    I personally like that they do not have innapproatie scenes, it can be hard to find a show like this in this day in age.
    The show demostrates struggles from differnt aspects of life as all of the siblibgs live a differnt type of life style.
    It is a sweet, heartfelt, show that can make you laugh and cry at the same time.
    Thier dad call them the <q>Big Three</q> which is fitting, because it seems like together they can get through anything.
    I love watching these shows and look forward to each episode. They do a good job on leaving you with wanting more.
